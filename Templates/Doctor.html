        <p>Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth major crop of the world (CIP, 1984) after rice, wheat and maize. Some inherent qualities give potato a competitive edge over the leading food crops. In fact, it is able to produce more protein and carbohydrates per unit area than cereals and some leguminous crops like soybeans (Crowell et al., 2008). In addition to energy and quality protein, it also provides a substantial amount of vitamins and minerals. According to Horton (1987) and Scott et al. (2000), potato is the most important crop in developing countries and its production is expanding more rapidly than that of most other crops. As a result of this, it is becoming an increasingly important source of rural employment, income and food for growing populations. Originating in the Andes, Latin America, potato was introduced to Ethiopia in the 19th century by a German Botanist Schimper (Pankhrust, 1964; Horton, 1987). It is grown by approximately 1 million farmers (CSA, 2008/2009). Potato is regarded a high-potential food security crop because of its ability to provide a high yield of high-quality product per unit input with a shorter crop cycle (mostly < 120 days) than major cereal crops like maize. Recently the price of cereals strongly increased worldwide and in Ethiopia the price subsequently stabilized at a high level, whereas the price of roots and</p>

        <p>The potato plant is attacked by many pathogens causing significant losses to potato producers throughout the world. Bacteria,  fungi, viruses, nematodes and phytoplasmas cause serious production constraints.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;" class="mt-5">2.1. Bacterial Diseases of Potato </h2>
         
        <p>Bacterial diseases of potato have had a decisive role in the cultivation of this crop. Several bacterial species can infect the potato plant and cause diseases; however, not all of these have a significant economical impact. Bacterial diseases are encountered more often in moist soils. The pathogens enter the plant via natural openings or wounds. The most damaging bacterial pathogens of potato which are also listed as quarantine pathogens are Bacterial ring rot, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, and bacterial wilt (or Brown rot) caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. Both are very destructive diseases and difficult to control. Because they are not present in all areas where the potato is grown, strict quarantine measures should be applied to prevent their spread.  </p>

        <p>Of the fungal diseases, late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, stands out from the rest. This disease is the nightmare of potato producers especially in the coastal wet regions. Late blight management programs of 15 sprays per season are not uncommon in wet and cool regions. Other significant fungal diseases include Verticillim  and  Fusarium  wilts. Both pathogens are soil borne and cause vascular wilt. Rhizoctonia canker and early blight are sometimes problematic (Choueiri et al., 2004).</p>

        <p>Several viruses infect the potato such as the Potato Virus Y, A, and X. These pathogens reduce plant vigor and yield. The potato cyst nematode, a quarantine organism, can cause serious reduction to yield (Choueiri et al., 2004).  </p>
